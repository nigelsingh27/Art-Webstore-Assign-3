**The file needs to be hosted on a server in order to run as they are PHP files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We kept a simple design, for a cleaner user interface.
On top of this, we felt that this provides the user with a better focus on the functionality of
our site.

The main languages used were CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP.

CSS was used for aesthetics. We kept a plain layout throughout the files, but even so, CSS
provided us with many functionalities such as positioning text and images where we wanted.

HTML was used throughout our web pages as we did not see a reason not to include it. It provides
great functionalities and is compatability with other languages, so an overall great basis for our
web pages. Parts 1, 3, and 4 heavily relied on HTML. This was because the requirements for
these parts could be easily achieved with predefined tags in this language.

JavaScript was used throughout many of the web pages to provide updates on the client side.
It was mainly used to tackle on parts 2 and 4, as it required us to update the main page with user
interaction. More specifically, we needed to display two small boxes on the same window whenever
the user clicked on an item in the Art Works or Artists drop down menues. With our understanding
of JavaScript, we ultimately chose it for these parts and wouldn't have wanted to choose another
language.

After Lab 3, we gained a significant understanding of the workings of PHP first hand. So, when it
came to part 6, that is, figuring out the Shopping Cart functionality, we knew that it would be the
best choice. The reason being was that there was a need for keeping track of values for the duration
of the user visit, and PHP already grants us this possibility through the use of sessions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A couple things to note:

The exact prices of the art works were not available.
So we made our own prices for the art works.
The quantity for each art work starts at 1, because there is only one of that particular art work.

We found that part 6 was not entirely clear.
The dialogue box had no restrictions so we chose to make a new window for it.
If the item was purchased, we simply just took the quantity out.
The total invoice is still displayed.
